2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net fishing/fcm/ffc/spi_word_reg[24][0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin fishing/fcm/ffc/oled_data_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell fishing/fcm/ffc/oled_data_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net fishing/fcm/fsc/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin fishing/fcm/fsc/man_frame_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell fishing/fcm/fsc/man_frame_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net fishing/fcm/fsc/oled_data_reg[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin fishing/fcm/fsc/submerged_reg_i_1/O, cell fishing/fcm/fsc/submerged_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net fishing/fcm/fsc/oled_data_reg[0]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin fishing/fcm/fsc/x_fish_reg[3]_i_1/O, cell fishing/fcm/fsc/x_fish_reg[3]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net fishing/fcm/fsc/oled_data_reg[3][0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin fishing/fcm/fsc/x_bait_reg[6]_i_1/O, cell fishing/fcm/fsc/x_bait_reg[6]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net fishing/fcm/fsc/spi_word_reg[24]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin fishing/fcm/fsc/zoom_in_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell fishing/fcm/fsc/zoom_in_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
